# LAT - LARA Autotuning Tool

## What is Lat

**Lat** is a tool for code autotuning, built using [LARA](https://web.fe.up.pt/~specs/projects/lara/doku.php) (a Javascript based language that support source code transformations) and applied using the [Clava](https://github.com/specs-feup/clava/tree/master/ClavaWeaver) tool . It is designed for C/C++. With it, coders may test multilple **variants** of their code dynamically and then choose the best variant to ship their code. 

**Lat** mimics [Intel Software Autotuning Tool (ISAT)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-software-autotuning-tool) behaviour for testing multiple instances of the same code. However, it is build entirely on LARA. Because of this it is platform agnostic and can be more flexible and easier to expand, both in functionalities and languages (not only C and C++).
